    <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
    <p>I enjoy playing video games and working on/building cars. I don't enjoy fixing cars but if its for a performance benefit or a visual mod to make it look better i'm all about it. Video games have been apart of my life since I was little. I grew up playing them with my dad and my uncles and have only continued. I started with Nintendo 64 from my dad to having almost all of the latest consoles out now. My favorite style game are first-person-shooters or racing games.</p>
