Serial killer, heart pumping at eyeballs killer dolls, chains edginess slicing horror, mental hospital putrid psychopath an possession. Mental hospital sliced drowning. Occult at alley pushed.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>I started my development career in 2014 when I began taking college classes at Macomb Community College. I started their program for an Associates Degree of Applied Science in IT Programming. Through these courses I learned the basics of Python, HTML, SQL, Java, Java for Mobile, Swift and C++. I now am pursuing Java further through a Java Bootcamp through Grand Circus!</p>
    <h2>Hometown</h2>
    <p>St. Clair Shores is where I was born and where i grew up at. I've been in the same house since I was 3 years old. Grew up going to Lake Shore public schools and playing recreational sports through city facilitations. I graduated from Lake Shore High School playing on the basketball team all 4 year I was there. St. Clair Shores is a small but large city consisting of 3 different public school systems.</p>
