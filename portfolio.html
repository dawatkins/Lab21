  <p>Our Mid-Term Project implemented a menu system for a fast food reasturant called <strong>Slop Shop</strong> . They had a very interesting selection of items on their menu but we turn down no customer when they ask for a product!</p>

  <p>This brilant console application allows a user to pick an opponent to play against and select their choice of <em>Rock, Paper</em> or <em> Scissors</em>. It also keeps track of their record against the opponent so you can know how well or how poorly you were against a lowsy computer.</p>
